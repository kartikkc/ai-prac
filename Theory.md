â€¢	Simple Linear Regression predicts the dependent variable based on a single independent variable, utilizing mathematical techniques to determine the best-fitting line.

A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a statistical visualization that provides a graphical summary of the distribution of a dataset. It displays key descriptive statistics, including the median, quartiles, and potential outliers. The plot is composed of several components:
1.	Box: The central box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which spans from the first quartile (Q1) to the third quartile (Q3). The length of the box therefore encompasses the middle 50% of the data. The line inside the box denotes the median (Q2), the value that separates the lower 50% from the upper 50% of the data.
2.	Whiskers: The whiskers extend from the edges of the box to the minimum and maximum values within a certain range. The length of the whiskers is typically determined by a specified multiplier of the IQR, often 1.5 times the IQR.
3.	Outliers: Points beyond the whiskers are considered potential outliers. Outliers are individual data points that fall significantly outside the expected range of values and may indicate unusual observations or errors in the data.
